    * virtualenv (recommended)

* Install pandas `pip install pandas`. **NOTE:** We recomend you do this in a virtualenv.

## Execution

To execute, use the following command in the current directory. If you installed pandas in a virtualenv, make sure the virtualenv is activated.

`python3 src/main.py data/dev/ output/dev.csv`

* data/dev specifies the directory with input text files. If your input is in another directory you can specify that directory instead.

* output/dev.csv specifies the output location. If you want to output to a different file you can specify that file instead.
